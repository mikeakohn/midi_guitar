midi_guitar
===========

This was originally an old project that was experimenting taking
a .wav file with guitar samples and convert it into MIDI notes
using DCT. This is now two projects in one repo, the second project
takes input realtime from a guitar and converts it into joystick
presses into the Linux kernel.

Each project is in their own directory:

* midi_guitar/
* guitarstick/
