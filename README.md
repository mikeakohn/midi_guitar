# midi_guitar

Convert sound samples into DCT's and output as midi notes.

This is just a project for experimenting with turning sound from .wav
files (and later live guitar) into DCT's for frequency analysis.  The
DCT's are then converted into midi notes and are written to a .mid file
and hopefully later to a live midi device.
